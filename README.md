### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Caelestia, many call me Caeleste or simply Cell.
I am a computer science student from Germany and I am mostly interested in hardware & embedded programming, cybersecurity and digital forensics.
Most of the time I'm writing little convenience scripts for Linux systems (which can sometimes get very specific and niche) and software for some of my hobby projects, including model rocketry, 3D printing and home automation.

Currently I am applying for an admission to the police academy, so I can study to become a detective specialised on Cybercrime. In the far future I'm hoping to be able to do a masters degree in digital forensics to work more in-depth on the criminal cases that need solving.

### My current projects
Most of my repositories are private because they are dedicated to personal projects and honestly because they look kinda messy and chaotic.
Feel free to check out the public ones on my profile, which are mostly there for learning and which I show to my friends and study mates for review and suggestions.
